# 480-Lab3_Calculator_Project

To run the code, make sure python 3.9 is installed on the machine and then open the file.
Optionally, can be run within Spyder IDE. Only tested on Windows 10.

To evalute a syntactically math expresion, simply type in the expresiion and hit enter for example "2+2" or "1 * 2" or "sin(-50) * 2", optionally, type 'exit'
and hit enter to exit the program.

Caculator supports integers as well as floating point number, negatvie number, trig functions including sin,cos,tan,cot, 
arcsin, arccos, arctan, and arcctg as well as logritihmic functions such as log and ln (log is base 10).


Important note, implicit multiplaction is not support, a '*' must be included in your entered statement.


Test Case Which Ecompasses Scope of Operators.

-5.78+-(4-2.23)+sin(0)*cos(1)/(1+tan(2*-ln(-3+2*(1.23+arcsin(1)))))

Evaluates -7.55 with 2 deciaml places.
